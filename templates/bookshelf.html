        <p class="book-meta">Lewis Dartnell &middot; August 2025</p>
        <p class="book-blurb">Read Dartnell's Being Human. Enjoyed how he connects human biology to major historical events. The Darien scheme chapter was fascinating. Had no idea disease destroyed Scotland's colonial ambitions and push them toward union with England. Some arguments felt overstated (was malaria a major factor in Yorktown?) but overall it's an engaging take on how our physical nature has steered civilization.</p>

        <h3>The Field Guide to Global Payments</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Sophia Goldberg &middot; September 2022</p>

        <p class="book-blurb">If there's one book you should read before the year ends it's Working Backwards, which details Amazon's processes for planning and measuring. IMO it's the reason Amazon executes so well. Written by former Amazon execs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book">
        <h3>Think Like Amazon: 50 1/2 Ideas to Become a Digital Leader</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">John Rossman &middot; November 2020</p>
        <p class="book-blurb">Loved 'Think Like Amazon'. It's by ex-Amazon exec John Rossman who distills all of the Amazoniasms that make the company so successful. I found the advice actionable and examples plenty. While every idea sounds simple, in practice it's hard to implement without the right culture. 6-pagers sound easy, but how many execs actually have the patience to read and dive deep into a problem? It's so much easier to BS with Powerpoint and hope for the best.</p>

        <p class="book-blurb">Excited to read Horowitz's book. Quarter of the way through Horowitz's new book and it's exceeded expectations. Toussaint Louverture is a fascinating figure. Horowitz does a good job of drawing leadership lessons from his life.</p>

        <h3>You Can Be a Stock Market Genius: Uncover the Secret Hiding Places of Stock Market Profits</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Joel Greenblatt &middot; July 2018</p>
        <p class="book-blurb">Joel Greenblatt's book is another one I really like that's probably not as applicable anymore. There is so much capital dedicated to special situation events like spinoffs, delistings and mergers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="book">
        <h3>Rework</h3>
        <p class="book-meta">Jason Fried & David Heinemeier Hansson &middot; May 2018</p>
        <p class="book-blurb">Read Rework. Didn't like it much. Was hoping for something like Ben Horowitz's book. This felt a bit 'listy'.</p>
