            <p class="book-blurb">Read Dartnell&#x27;s Being Human. Enjoyed how he connects human biology to major historical events. The Darien scheme chapter was fascinating. Had no idea disease destroyed Scotland&#x27;s colonial ambitions and push them toward union with England. Some arguments felt overstated (was malaria a major factor in Yorktown?) but overall it&#x27;s an engaging take on how our physical nature has steered civilization.</p>

            <p class="book-meta">Annie Jacobsen &middot; September 2024</p>
            <p class="book-blurb">A terrifyingly vivid look at nuclear protocols. Learned there&#x27;s still no effective defense against ICBM&#x2F;SLBMs—more fragile than ever as more countries acquire them. Not a bedtime read.</p>

            <p class="book-blurb">Almost done with Lifespan. Highly recommend if you&#x27;re interested in biology. Was pleasantly surprised to see Information Theory brought up.

            <p class="book-meta">Colin Bryar &amp; Bill Carr &middot; December 2021</p>
            <p class="book-blurb">If there&#x27;s one book you should read before the year ends it&#x27;s Working Backwards, which details Amazon&#x27;s processes for planning and measuring. IMO it&#x27;s the reason Amazon executes so well. Written by former Amazon execs.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="book">
            <h3>Think Like Amazon: 50 1&#x2F;2 Ideas to Become a Digital Leader</h3>
            <p class="book-meta">John Rossman &middot; November 2020</p>
            <p class="book-blurb">Loved &#x27;Think Like Amazon&#x27;. It&#x27;s by ex-Amazon exec John Rossman who distills all of the Amazoniasms that make the company so successful. I found the advice actionable and examples plenty. While every idea sounds simple, in practice it&#x27;s hard to implement without the right culture. 6-pagers sound easy, but how many execs actually have the patience to read and dive deep into a problem? It&#x27;s so much easier to BS with Powerpoint and hope for the best.</p>
        </div>

            <p class="book-blurb">Highly recommend Bad Blood. It&#x27;s amazing Theranos lasted 12 years before outsiders realized it was vaporware. Another valuable lesson never to trust the &#x27;smart money&#x27;.</p>

            <p class="book-blurb">Joel Greenblatt&#x27;s book is another one I really like that&#x27;s probably not as applicable anymore. There is so much capital dedicated to special situation events like spinoffs, delistings and mergers.</p>
