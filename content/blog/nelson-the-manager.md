In 1798, Nelson's frigates were destroyed in a storm off Sardinia. For two months he searched for Napoleon's invasion fleet without reconnaissance assets. He passed them in the dark. Arrived at Malta after they'd taken it and left. Reached Alexandria on June 28th, found nothing, sailed away. Napoleon arrived July 1st.

When Nelson finally caught them at Aboukir Bay on August 1st, the battle began at sunset and continued into darkness. Ships fought by muzzle flash. Smoke made signals impossible. L'Orient, the French flagship, caught fire around 10 PM and exploded, lighting the bay for fifteen minutes before going dark again. Fighting continued until 3 AM.

Nelson took shrapnel to the head early in the battle and was carried below deck, blinded by blood. His captains fought in darkness without signals, without orders, without their commander. They captured or destroyed eleven of thirteen French ships.

The question isn't how Nelson communicated during that battle. He couldn't. The question is what he'd communicated beforehand.

## Working Sessions

Before major battles, Nelson gathered his captains for dinner, then spent hours working through the plan. Not briefing them. Working through it together. "What if the wind shifts?" "What if they refuse to engage?" "What if we lose formation?"

Captains argued, suggested alternatives, pointed out problems. Sometimes Nelson changed the plan. Sometimes he kept it but explained his reasoning. He wanted them to see how he thought about naval combat so that when something unexpected happened, they'd know what he'd prioritize.

At the Nile, Captain Foley commanded Goliath, the lead ship. As the British approached the French line anchored in Aboukir Bay, Foley spotted enough depth to sail between the French ships and shore. This would trap the French in crossfire from both sides. It wasn't in the plan. Foley did it anyway. The ships behind him followed his lead.

They'd absorbed that Nelson wanted aggressive action and exploitation of opportunities over rigid execution. When the situation changed, they adapted in ways consistent with how Nelson thought.

## The Circulating Order Book

Nelson kept a book of standing orders that went from ship to ship. Captains read it, made notes, passed it on. Not procedures. Principles and reasoning.

"I prefer close-quarters engagement because it neutralizes their superior numbers by making battles about crew quality, not firepower. When you can't see my signals, engage the nearest enemy ship as closely as possible."

He gave them the logic behind his decisions so they could make their own decisions using the same framework.

His Trafalgar Memorandum ended: "In case signals can neither be seen nor perfectly understood, no Captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of the enemy." Simple. Memorable. Applicable when smoke obscured everything else.

## Priority Hierarchies

Nelson's written orders anticipated communication breakdown. They weren't if-then procedures. They were priority hierarchies.

Aggressive action over maintaining formation. Close engagement over standoff tactics. Seizing opportunities over waiting for permission.

When captains faced situations not covered by specific orders, they had rules for what mattered most.

At Copenhagen in 1801, Admiral Parker signaled Nelson to retreat. Nelson put his telescope to his blind eye, claimed not to see the signal, and kept attacking. He won. He later told the Duke of Clarence: "To serve my king, and to destroy the French, I consider as the great order of all, from which little ones spring; and if one of these little ones militate against it, I go back and obey the great order."

He had a hierarchy of priorities and the political courage to violate lower-order rules when they conflicted with higher-order objectives. His captains needed the same clarity to make their own judgment calls.

But this only worked because he'd built trust beforehand. Parker didn't court-martial him because Nelson had spent months demonstrating sound judgment. You can't establish that trust when communication breaks down. You build it through repeated demonstration.

## Shared Risk

Before Trafalgar began, Nelson sent one final signal: "England expects that every man will do his duty."

He had one last chance to transmit orders and used it to express trust instead. His captains already knew what to do.

Nelson commanded from Victory, a 104-gun first-rate ship positioned to lead one of the two columns piercing the enemy line. This made Victory the primary target. His staff begged him to transfer his flag to a faster frigate where he could command from safety. He refused.

Victory took fire from multiple enemy ships as she approached. Her mizzen topmast was shot away. Her wheel was destroyed. Fifty men were killed or wounded before she fired a shot. Nelson was shot by a French sniper and died three hours later, after learning his fleet had won.

His presence on Victory wasn't necessary for tactical command. But his captains fought harder knowing Nelson was in the same danger they were.

## Managing Credit and Blame

After the Nile, Captain Saumarez was senior, technically Nelson's second-in-command. Nelson preferred Troubridge. Rather than resolve this by naming one and insulting the other in official dispatches, Nelson simply didn't name either. He used "Band of Brothers" language deliberately to ensure all his captains got recognition.

He'd learned this from watching earlier battles create political fights. After the Glorious First of June in 1794, Admiral Howe's dispatch omitted several captains' names, creating bitter controversy. Nelson saw it coming and prevented it.

Historian Andrew Lambert wrote that Nelson "never overrode the judgment of those whom he had ordered to execute well-defined tasks. He always worked through the proper chain of command to avoid giving offense, or undermine the confidence of promising officers. If things went wrong, he was the first to leap to the defense of a bold and decisive subordinate."

Nelson's captains knew the asymmetry: success would be attributed to them, failure would land on Nelson. If they thought failure would be blamed on them, they'd never take the risks he needed them to take.

## What Carries Over

Organizations still coordinate at scale. Communication still degrades under pressure. People still need to make good decisions without asking for permission.

Nelson built working sessions to develop shared understanding before battles. He wrote principles and reasoning, not procedures. He communicated priority hierarchies clearly enough that people could make judgment calls in novel situations. His orders explicitly planned for when signals failed. He positioned himself where danger was highest. He managed how success and failure were attributed to shape future behavior.

Most companies respond with more procedures. Write the playbook. Document the process. Add another approval layer. This works until something happens that's not in the playbook. Then people either wait for permission that won't come in time, or they guess wrong about what you'd want.

Nelson's approach was different. He ran working sessions where captains argued with him about tactics, so they learned how he thought. He wrote down his reasoning, not just his conclusions. He communicated priorities clearly enough that people could figure out the right call when facing something new. He made sure people knew that taking initiative wouldn't get them blamed if it went wrong.

When communication matters most, it often fails. The question is what you've communicated beforehand.
