While Silcon Valley fawns over Napoleon, particularly for his Founder Mode micromanagement style, I think a lot more lessons on scaling startups can be drawn from Bonapartes's naval nemesis, Horatio Nelson.

Nelson stands as history's most celebrated naval commander. His remarkable series of triumphs at sea cemented Britain's supremacy on the world's oceans. A dominance that would endure for over a century beyond his lifetime.

After reading Andrew Lambert's book "Nelson: Brittania's God of War", I was struck by how much of Nelson's success can be attributed to his communication style and leadership approach. While his leadership and courage is legendary, I wanted to focus on the communication lessons that can be applied to scaling startups.

## The Battle of the Nile

In 1798, Nelson’s frigates were destroyed in a storm off Sardinia. For two months he searched for Napoleon’s invasion fleet without reconnaissance assets. He passed them in the dark. Reached Malta after they had taken it and left. Arrived at Alexandria on June 28th, found nothing, and sailed away. Napoleon landed three days later.

When Nelson finally caught them at Aboukir Bay on August 1st, what was to become the Battle of the Nile began at sunset and continued into darkness. Ships fought by muzzle flash. Smoke made signals impossible. Around 10 PM, L’Orient, the French flagship, caught fire and exploded, lighting the bay for fifteen minutes before plunging it back into darkness. Fighting continued until 3 AM.

Nelson took shrapnel to the head early in the battle and was carried below deck, blinded by blood. His captains fought through the night without signals, orders, or their commander. Yet they captured or destroyed eleven of thirteen French ships, a winning rate unprecedented in naval history until Trafalgar.

The question isn't how Nelson communicated during that battle. He obviously couldn't. The question is what he'd communicated beforehand.

## Working Sessions

Before major battles, Nelson gathered his captains for dinner, then spent hours working through the plan. Not briefing them. Working through it together. "What if the wind shifts?" "What if they refuse to engage?" "What if we lose formation?"

Captains argued, suggested alternatives, pointed out problems. Sometimes Nelson changed the plan. Sometimes he kept it but explained his reasoning. He wanted them to see how he thought about naval combat so that when something unexpected happened, they'd know what he'd prioritize.

At the Nile, Captain Foley commanded _Goliath_, the lead ship. As the British approached the French line anchored in Aboukir Bay, Foley spotted enough depth to sail between the French ships and shore. This would trap the French in crossfire from both sides. It wasn't in the plan. Foley did it anyway. The ships behind him followed his lead.

They had learned that Nelson valued aggressive initiative and exploitation of opportunity over rigid obedience. When conditions changed, they adapted in ways consistent with his thinking.

## The Circulating Order Book

To reinforce this, Nelson kept a circulating order book that passed from ship to ship. Each captain read it, annotated it, and passed it along. The book didn’t prescribe procedures. It explained reasoning.

“I prefer close-quarters engagement,” he wrote, “because it neutralizes their superior numbers by making battles about crew quality, not firepower. When you can’t see my signals, engage the nearest enemy ship as closely as possible.”

By giving his captains the logic behind his preferences, he made them independent extensions of his judgment. His orders were principles, not scripts.

That same clarity appeared in his Trafalgar Memorandum: “In case signals can neither be seen nor perfectly understood, no Captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of the enemy.” It was simple, memorable, and actionable—guidance designed to outlast the failure of communication itself.

## Shared Risk

That trust was also reinforced by shared risk. Before Trafalgar began, Nelson sent one final signal: “England expects that every man will do his duty.” It wasn’t an order—it was a statement of confidence. His captains already knew what to do.

Nelson commanded from _Victory_, a 104-gun ship leading one of two columns piercing the enemy line. It was the most dangerous position, and his officers begged him to transfer his flag to a safer frigate. He refused.

As Victory approached, she took fire from multiple ships. Her masts and wheel were destroyed; fifty men were killed or wounded before she fired a shot. Nelson was struck by a sniper and died three hours later—after learning his fleet had won.

His decision to fight from Victory wasn’t necessary tactically. It was necessary symbolically. By sharing the risks his captains faced, he made it easier for them to act with conviction when it mattered.

## Managing Credit and Blame

After the Nile, Captain Saumarez was senior, technically Nelson's second-in-command. Nelson preferred Troubridge. Rather than resolve this by naming one and insulting the other in official dispatches, Nelson simply didn't name either. He used "Band of Brothers" language deliberately to ensure all his captains got recognition.

He'd learned this from watching earlier battles create political fights. After the Glorious First of June in 1794, Admiral Howe's dispatch omitted several captains' names, creating bitter controversy. Nelson saw it coming and prevented it.

Historian Andrew Lambert wrote that Nelson "never overrode the judgment of those whom he had ordered to execute well-defined tasks. He always worked through the proper chain of command to avoid giving offense, or undermine the confidence of promising officers. If things went wrong, he was the first to leap to the defense of a bold and decisive subordinate."

Nelson's captains knew the asymmetry: success would be attributed to them, failure would land on Nelson. If they thought failure would be blamed on them, they'd never take the risks he needed them to take.

## What Carries Over

Modern organizations face the same challenge Nelson did: coordinating complex action across distance, uncertainty, and speed. Teams must act without perfect information or constant approval. Most leaders respond with more rules and layers of oversight—measures that make coordination safer but slower. In fast-moving environments, delay is as dangerous as confusion.

Nelson chose the opposite path. He built alignment before the fight, not during it. He communicated principles, not procedures. He made priorities explicit so judgment could replace instruction. He planned for signals to fail and trust to endure. He led from the front and gave away credit, creating a culture where initiative wasn’t just allowed—it was expected.

His lessons translate directly to scaling organizations today:

1. **Make priorities explicit and keep them simple.** When judgment calls arise, clear principles beat detailed rules. A few crisp ideas guide behavior better than a thick playbook. Can everyone on your team answer, "What's our top priority?" the same way?
2. **Lead from the front and show trust deliberately.** Trust grows fastest when people see you take the same risks—and know boldness will be rewarded, not punished. Tell people you trust them, especially when you're not in the room. Camaraderie doesn't happen by accident.
3. **Build shared understanding early by documenting your reasoning.** Don't brainstorm or decide by committee—it slows you down. But work through the plan with your team to refine it, explaining why it exists, not just what it says. People move faster when they understand the thinking behind decisions so they can adapt to changing circumstances.
