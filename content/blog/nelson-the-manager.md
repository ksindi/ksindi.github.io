In 1798, Nelson's frigates were destroyed in a storm off Sardinia. For two months he searched for Napoleon's invasion fleet without reconnaissance assets. He passed them in the dark. Arrived at Malta after they'd taken it and left. Reached Alexandria on June 28th, found nothing, sailed away. Napoleon arrived July 1st.

When Nelson finally caught them at Aboukir Bay on August 1st, the battle began at sunset and continued into darkness. Ships fought by muzzle flash. Smoke made signals impossible. L'Orient, the French flagship, caught fire around 10 PM and exploded, lighting the bay for fifteen minutes before going dark again. Fighting continued until 3 AM.

Nelson took shrapnel to the head early in the battle and was carried below deck, blinded by blood. For hours his captains fought in darkness without orders. They captured or destroyed eleven of thirteen French ships.

The question isn't how Nelson commanded that battle. He didn't. The question is what he'd done beforehand that let his captains fight for hours without him.

## The Working Sessions

Before major battles, Nelson gathered his captains for dinner, then spent hours working through the plan. Not briefing. Working through. "What if the wind shifts?" "What if they refuse to engage?" "What if we lose formation?"

Captains argued, suggested alternatives, pointed out problems. Sometimes Nelson changed the plan. Sometimes he kept it but explained why. He wanted them to understand how he thought about naval combat so that when something unexpected happened, they'd know what he'd prioritize.

At the Nile, Captain Foley commanded Goliath, the lead ship. As the British approached the French line anchored in Aboukir Bay, Foley spotted enough depth to sail between the French ships and shore. This would trap the French in crossfire from both sides. It wasn't in the plan. Foley did it anyway. The ships behind him followed his lead.

They'd absorbed that Nelson wanted aggressive action and exploitation of opportunities over rigid execution. When the situation changed, they adapted in ways consistent with how Nelson thought.

## The Circulating Order Book

Nelson kept a book of standing orders that went from ship to ship. Captains read it, made notes, passed it on. Not procedures. Principles and reasoning. "I prefer close-quarters engagement because it neutralizes their superior numbers by making battles about crew quality, not firepower. When you can't see my signals, engage the nearest enemy ship as closely as possible."

In battle, smoke obscured signal flags within minutes. Ships became autonomous. Captains couldn't ask for guidance. They needed to have internalized how Nelson thought before the fighting started.

His Trafalgar Memorandum ended: "In case signals can neither be seen nor perfectly understood, no Captain can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of the enemy." This wasn't poetry. It was acknowledgment that communication would fail, and a decision rule for when it did.

## Selection Pressure

After the Nile, Nelson didn't invite three captains back. Gould had made no major mistakes and handled his ship competently. But while other captains showed initiative. Under pressure he executed orders but didn't think.

Troubridge, one of Nelson's best captains, ran aground before the Nile and missed the battle entirely. Bad luck, not bad judgment. Nelson kept him. Troubridge performed brilliantly in later actions.

Edward Berry, Nelson's flag captain, was described as "prone to serious errors of judgement at sea," but Nelson kept him too. Berry had qualities that mattered more in that specific role.

Nelson watched how captains actually performed under pressure, then calibrated how much autonomy each one got. Some received broad objectives and full latitude. Others got tighter supervision. He didn't delegate uniformly by rank.

## Writing for When Communication Breaks

Nelson's written orders anticipated communication breakdown. They weren't if-then procedures. They were priority hierarchies: aggressive action over maintaining formation, close engagement over standoff tactics, seizing opportunities over waiting for permission.

When captains faced situations not covered by specific orders, they had rules for what mattered most.

At Copenhagen in 1801, Admiral Parker signaled Nelson to retreat. Nelson put his telescope to his blind eye, claimed not to see the signal, and kept attacking. He won. This wasn't the first time. Nelson told the Duke of Clarence: "To serve my king, and to destroy the French, I consider as the great order of all, from which little ones spring; and if one of these little ones militate against it, I go back and obey the great order."

He had a hierarchy of priorities and the political courage to violate lower-order rules when they conflicted with higher-order objectives. But this only worked because he'd built trust beforehand. Parker didn't court-martial him because Nelson had spent months demonstrating sound judgment. You can't establish that trust when you need it. You build it through repeated demonstration that you understand when to follow rules and when to override them.

## Political Management

At the Nile, Captain Saumarez was senior, technically Nelson's second-in-command. Nelson preferred Troubridge. Rather than resolve this by naming one and insulting the other, Nelson simply didn't name either in official dispatches.

He'd learned this from watching earlier battles create political fights. After the Glorious First of June in 1794, Admiral Howe's dispatch omitted several captains' names. It created bitter controversy. Nelson used "Band of Brothers" language deliberately to ensure all his captains got recognition and medals. He saw the political problem coming and prevented it.

But his management of credit and blame went deeper. Historian Andrew Lambert wrote that Nelson "never overrode the judgment of those whom he had ordered to execute well-defined tasks. He always worked through the proper chain of command to avoid giving offense, or undermine the confidence of promising officers. If things went wrong, he was the first to leap to the defense of a bold and decisive subordinate."

Nelson's captains knew the asymmetry: success would be recognized and attributed to them. Failure would land on Nelson. After Santa Cruz, Admiral Jervis took responsibility for the failed operation rather than blaming Nelson. Nelson did the same for his captains. This wasn't generosity. It was the price of getting people to exercise initiative. If they thought failure would be blamed on them, they'd never take the risks he needed them to take.

## Trust Through Shared Risk

At Trafalgar, Nelson commanded from Victory, a 104-gun first-rate ship. He positioned her to lead one of the two columns that would pierce the enemy line. This made Victory the primary target for every French and Spanish ship she approached. Nelson's staff begged him to transfer his flag to a faster frigate where he could command from a safer position. He refused.

Victory took fire from multiple enemy ships as she approached the Franco-Spanish line. Her mizzen topmast was shot away. Her wheel was destroyed. Fifty men were killed or wounded before she fired a shot. When she finally broke through and engaged, Nelson was shot by a French sniper. He died three hours later, after learning his fleet had won.

His presence on Victory wasn't necessary for tactical command. He could have directed the battle from anywhere. But his captains fought harder knowing Nelson shared their risks. As naval historian Alfred Thayer Mahan wrote, Nelson's trust in his subordinates rested "upon the presumption in others of that same devotion to duty, that same zeal to perform it, which he found himself."

Before the battle began, Nelson sent one final signal: "England expects that every man will do his duty." He had one last chance to transmit orders and used it to express trust instead. His captains already knew what to do.

## What Actually Transfers

Nelson built systems that functioned when communication failed. He used working sessions to build shared understanding of how he thought, not just what the current plan was. He documented priorities and reasoning, not procedures. He had the political courage to override lower-order rules when they conflicted with mission objectives. He calibrated delegation based on observed judgment. He wrote orders that provided decision rules when people couldn't ask questions. He managed credit and blame asymmetrically to encourage initiative. He positioned himself where risk was highest to demonstrate shared commitment.

The underlying problem hasn't changed. Organizations still coordinate at scale. Communication still degrades under pressure. People still need to make good decisions without asking for permission. The specifics differ but the mechanics carry over.
