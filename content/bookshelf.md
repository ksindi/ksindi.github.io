author = "John Rossman"
date = "November 2020"
blurb = "Loved 'Think Like Amazon'. It's by ex-Amazon exec John Rossman who distills all of the Amazoniasms that make the company so successful. I found the advice actionable and examples plenty. While every idea sounds simple, in practice it's hard to implement without the right culture. 6-pagers sound easy, but how many execs actually have the patience to read and dive deep into a problem? It's so much easier to BS with Powerpoint and hope for the best."
