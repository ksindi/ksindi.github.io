[Blog post](https://www.jwplayer.com/blog/deepwalk-recommendations/) on open sourcing JWalk, our
Cython-based implementation of DeepWalk.

JWalk performs random walks on a graph and learns representations for nodes using Word2Vec.
It also has options to train existing models online and specify weights.
